            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Admiſſion of perſons baptized in their infancy, without due Tryal of their Faith and growth in Chriſt, when grown in years, to a full participation of all Church-Priviledges and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, hath cauſed great confuſion in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of holy things. And therefore, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Learned Author of this Elaborate Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation hath deſerved well of the Churches, by clearing the way of thoſe Admiſſions from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-grounds, and the concurrent Teſtimonies of many, both Antient and Modern writers: As alſo, by diſcovering and removing thoſe Popiſh addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pollutions which by ſeveral ſteps and degrees have crept into it. And if, what he hath offered in this Eſſay come not up to the Judgment and Practice of the beſt conſtituted Churches; yet this ingenuous and pious overture holds out more then moſt Churches have hitherto attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and may provoke the zeal of many to hold out what they have attained, as more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for, and perfective of the much deſired and longed for reſtauration of the Churches to their primitive purity both in ſeparating the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious from the vile, and in uniting the pretious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more beautiful and beneficial Order among themſelves. Theſe conſiderations have confirmed me in giving not only Licenſe to the publiſhing, but thanks to the Publiſher of this diſcourſe of Confirmation.</p>

            <p>When the Lord ſhall graciouſly vouch. ſafe opportunity of putting theſe things in practice among you, I hope (and not without ſome ground) that you will be found a ready and willing people to receive and ſubmit unto them, ſo far as they ſhall appear to be agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind of Chriſt, and to make for his glory: And in ſo doing you

            <p>Now that the Father of Lights would fill you with the knowledg of his Will, in all Wiſdom and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Underſtanding, and enable you to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God. That the God of all Grace would ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen and ſettle you in his Truth and Wayes in theſe-evil dayes, wherein ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and unſtable ſouls turn aſide from the truth, giving ear to deceivers that with fair words and pretences corrupt the minds of the ſimple, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, the grief of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, the offence of his People, and the hurt and hazard of their own Souls.</p>

The Apoſtles (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received it from Chriſt, and being inſpired by his Spirit) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and left behind them unto the Churches, a perfect Rule and Pattern for their Direction and Imitation; which they ought to have followed and kept cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:

<pb facs="tcp:58862:10"/>manner of proceeding, as having better opportunity then others to know their way in matter of Fact: which is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal uſes to be made of the writings of the antients, and for which they juſtly deſerve our due eſteem and diligent peruſal.</p>
            <p>As for the former of theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Doctrines, thoſe Worthies whom the Lord in thoſe latter daies (wherein Antichriſt was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the ſpirit of his mouth in the miniſtry of his ſervants) was pleaſed to raiſe up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy for the reſcue and releaſe of captiv'd Truth, and the refining of it from Antichriſtian mixtures, by having recourſe to the Word, and examining thoſe Doctrines that were commonly taught and received as the truths of God. By this ſtraight rule they through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of truth,
<pb facs="tcp:58862:10"/>ſoon came to ſee, and ſeeing to diſcover the obliquity of them, and by the bleſſing of the Lord, made a happy progreſs to doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reformation. The more to be admired, and the goodneſs of the Lord therein magnified, if we conſider what Anakims and Goliahs they had to contend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; in regard of the temporal power ſiding with, and ſeconding them, the ſtream of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes violently running with them, (for all the world wondred after the Beaſt) and in regard of the deep roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that thoſe errours by reaſon of their long continuance,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.3</note> had taken in the mindes of men, cuſtom with them having the force of a Law.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo clearly did the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to diſcern the truth from errour, and ſo wel-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly confident were they of the
<pb facs="tcp:58862:11"/>ſoundneſs of what they held, and ſandyneſs of what they oppugned, that they feared not to grapple with the adverſary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his advantages; putting to flight the armies of the Aliens, each encounter proving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; with their Rams-horns have they batterd and made ſuch breaches in the wals of Jericho, as ſhall never again be repaired; yea to that height of skill and courage did they attain, that like champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (having beaten him from the Scriptures) they durſt challenge the adverſary at his own Weapon, and to aſſault him in that his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſtrong hold of antiquity, which he had betaken himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for ſhelter: A challenge not more boldly made (as far as to 600. years after Chriſt, the only time worth the name of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) then wiſely managed and

            <p>As for the things that concern Diſcipline and Order, thoſe choice Spirits might haply the leſſe heed them, as reſpecting only the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wel-being of the Church; having enough to do in dealing with thoſe more weighty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, whereupon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being, at leaſt the ſoundneſs of it as to ſubſtantials did depend. Hence it came to paſs that ſo much rubbiſh ſtill remained in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations after all the pains they had taken in purging; ſo that though the languiſhing Church were well recovered in reſpect of the danger her vitals were in, yet even to this day could ſhe never attain unto her native co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and comlineſs. A task which ſeems to belong unto us, and
<pb facs="tcp:58862:12"/>which the Lord hath reſerved for this period of time, wherein the work of Reformation is to be carried on to greater perfection. In order hereunto, and as making way for it, we have ſeen the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence bringing ſtrange things to paſs, ſuch as we yet ſcarce looked for, nor could conceive how they ſhould be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. What Mountains have been leveld and removed out of the way? what an heap of humane inventions that had invaded the Worſhip &amp; Ordinances of Chriſt, and tyrannical uſurpations in the Diſcipline of the Church, have been caſt out and aboliſhed, though ſo riveted, and of ſuch continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that, for their pretended Right, they could plead Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Poſſeſſion time out of mind? This was the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſervedly marvelous in
<pb facs="tcp:58862:12"/>our eyes. Moreover, what a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer and Supplication hath the Lord poured out upon his people in reference to this thing? How hath he ſet it on upon their hearts as the proper work of their day? What enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath there been after a right way? diſcuſſing of what's dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain, diſcoveries of what was dark and obſcure; and to what a height have the hopes and expectations of the Saints been raiſed of the accompliſhment of what hath been foretold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed concerning Sions recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her Greatneſſe and Glory, and her being made a praiſe in the earth?</p>
            <p>All which call loudly upon us, each in our places, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to put to our helping hand and to afford our utmoſt aſſiſtance for
<pb facs="tcp:58862:13"/>the promoting of this bleſſed work; and the rather, becauſe they are ſo few whoſe hearts have been made willing to ſet about and undertake it, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein are ſo many and great; partly through the multiplicity of corruptions that have been ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, and even incorporated into Church-adminiſtrations, not eaſily to be ſevered from them; partly from the violence of ſuch as ſtand for,<note place="margin">Conſuetudo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne veritate, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſtas Erroris eſt.

Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to may be added, the pertinacious humour of the generality among us, crying up their great Diana, and eagerly oppoſing and fruſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:58862:13"/>what they can, the endevours of thoſe that would remove them, and deſire to reduce things to the Primitive pattern: True Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity being through ignorance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed by the multitude under the name of Novelty; and what is but of yeſterday, and a later birth, fondly imagined to be, and doted on, as if <hi>ab initio</hi> and of Apoſtolical inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Among other, the confuſion in our Congregations as to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them, all heaped together without any diſtinction, is not the leaſt <hi>remora</hi> and obſtruſtion in the way of Reformation: which hath created no ſmall trouble, and occaſion'd many hot conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe, who have laboured to regulate and bring things into better order in this regard; the different apprehenſions of men in this particular, producing unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:58862:14"/>Animoſityes, and ſadning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances between thoſe, whoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be exceeding amiable, and of conſiderable advantage.</p>
            <p>That a diſtinction of perſons is neceſſary, is on all hands granted by the friends of Reformation: But to find out what this ought to be, what are the places or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be aſſigned to, and the priviledges to be injoyed by them; how they are to be conſidered, and in what ſtate to be accounted of, according to their ſeveral capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and qualifications, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an help hereunto was this Exercitation undertaken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: Wherein from the beſt Antiquity it appears, that in the Primitive times there were in, and belonging to the Church perſons of ſeveral ſorts and ſizes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly of ſeveral ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
<pb facs="tcp:58862:14"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Catechumens, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, imperfect; alſo adult, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and perfect: <hi>recens nati</hi> and ſuch as were in their minority; alſo ſome grown up to maturity and of full age in an Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe. And that the ordinary way by which they paſſed from the one ſtate into the other, was the antient rite of Impoſition of hands or Confirmation; which through the iniquity and corruption of the darker times, was ſo alterd (though not altogether laid aſide) that it was quite perverted from its firſt intendment, the true uſe and end thereof being even loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, by reaſon whereof great inconveniences and miſchiefs have enſued and long prevailed, to the great detriment of the Church; not in likelyhood to be removed (as the fruitleſneſs of endeavours hitherto have ſhewn) but by the
<pb facs="tcp:58862:15"/>reduction of this laudable practice into the Churches of Chriſt, the drift and ſcope of the following diſcourſe: which being but in part finiſhed,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:58862:15"/>cauſe to thank you too, and to bleſſe God for you, who did in much mercy (as I truſt) guide you to this undertaking, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As tis here tendred to the peruſal, and ſubmitted unto the judgement of the godly-wiſe: ſo is thy candid interpretation and friendly acceptances deſired of thee.

            <p>And that this may be the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb facs="tcp:58862:16"/>of this weak labour, thou art earneſtly deſired by thy prayers to recommond it to the bleſſing of the Lord, by him who deſires to be found <hi>An unfeigned lover of Truth and Peace,</hi> I. H.</p>

            <p>HEaring of the following Treatiſe to be in the Preſs, and being deſired to give my thoughts thereof, I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, according to the cognizance had of it, to commend the main Contents, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our preſent time. I had in my hand ſome moneths paſt, a few ſheets from the Author of the ſame Argument, which now, I hear, is grown into a greater volume: The matter aſſerted therein, was the due diſpoſition, growth and preparation of the Baptized unto Participation in the Lords Supper, collected from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the concurrent votes of the Church in ſome ſucceeding ages. In which, more than Dogmatical Faith, and Negative holineſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be requiſite unto worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>The proof of this, was the care taken of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Baptiſed in their minority, to nurture them up in the Faith, and orderly watching to the rule of Chriſt: And after due experience, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them, and admittance to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in higher Myſteries.</p>
            <p>This Confirmation or <hi>Approbation</hi> of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized being now adult, and making confeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:58862:17"/>of repentance towards God, &amp; faith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is by ſome glorious lights in the Church underſtood in that phraſe of <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> annexed to Baptiſms,<note place="margin">Hic unus locus abundè teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur hujus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniae Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem fluxiſſe ab Apoſtolis, &amp;c.

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. Whence it is ſaid, <hi>That this One place doth abundantly teſtifie, that the Original of this Ceremony flowed from the Apoſtles,</hi> though afterward it was turned into Superſtition, as other of the beſt Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God. And again, <hi>That this place maketh to the proof of Infani-Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What grounding <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> or <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Impoſition of hands have in this Scripture, I will not now diſpute? but unleſs there were more expreſs and firm ground for both, we might be at a loſs concerning theſe Ordinances. What if it ſhould be ſaid, That Jewiſh Baptiſms and Impoſition of hands are meant here by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writing to the Hebrews? and that theſe among them did teach Repentance from dead works, and Faith in God, and the Reſurrection of the dead, and Eternal Judgment?</p>
            <p>All this is truth: Theſe were among the reſt of the Jewiſh Rites, the very Principles &amp; Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Elements which taught Chriſt, though moſt of them were dull of hearing, and did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him by them.</p>
            <p>But let this paſs; As to the <hi>Initiation</hi> of <hi>Church-Infants,</hi> we have a ſure word of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that cannot be broken. And that this muſt be done by Baptiſm, muſt be granted, or elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way diſcovered. And as for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them ſolemnly by prayer and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Communion, after their parental nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Elements of Religion, and experience
<pb facs="tcp:58862:17"/>of their profiting in faith and godlyneſſe by Eccleſiaſtical inſtitution; the Author in this Treatiſe, I hope, will give ſufficient proof.</p>
            <p>The abuſe of this by Popiſh Blaſphemies, and Prelatical Corruptions cannot be denied, ſo that it hath been odious and ridiculous; but to reſtore it to Primitive purity, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more exactly to the education of Infants in the Church, and nurturing them according to their capacities, and at length approving and eſtabliſhing them in the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, cannot but be judged rational and Chriſtian, if wee take theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Light of Nature guideth, as to help children according to capacity, to natural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo to know above all the God of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: It is an opinion worſe than Brutiſh not to ſeaſon that tender age with ſome things of God, as it can receive them. It is not taking Gods Name in vain, reaſonably to make him known to the weakeſt underſtanding that it may grow therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Ordinance of God in the Old Church for the appearing of the Males before him three times at leaſt in the year, was to nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture them and bring them to more acquaintance with God, and Confirm them in his Truth. And is there not need to keep Analogie, with that for perfecting Souls toward God under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the many Exhortations in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for watching over the Flock, to feed the
<pb facs="tcp:58862:18"/>lambs, to perfect, to ſtabliſh Souls in the truth, cannot but imply the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of ſuch a practice in the Church for the nurturing of tender ages, and at laſt Confirming them in Chriſt. To the edifying whereof, I am confident the Author hath his main ſcope, and I ſhall pray he may not miſs of his aim. The Lord own that which is his in the Work, and make it proſper. In him I am,</p>

            <p>IT is now many years ſince I wrote a paſſage in a book, called, The <hi>Sains Reſt,</hi> Part, 4: Chap. 4. Sect 3. which ſince I printed ſome miſunderſtood, as if I affirmed the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Baptiſm alone for qualifying perſons to be admitted by us to the Church-Communion of the Adult: Whereas I there expreſſe that [A Sober Profeſſion of Repentance and Faith in Chriſt] if they be adult, is neceſſary to qualifie them firſt for that Baptiſm, and that they muſt after [produce that Evidence, not blotted by Hereſie or Scandalous ſin,] In which I plainly ſuppoſed that thoſe that were Baptized in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, muſt alſo at age produce the Evidence of an Infant-Baptiſm, upon the Parents profeſſion, with their own actual profeſſion when adult. But becauſe I found ſome underſtood not that which is written in few words, I have ſince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times explained it in ſeveral Treatiſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in one of Infant-Baptiſm, and one lately of Right to Sacraments. In the former, many
<pb facs="tcp:58862:19"/>years ſince I found it meet in dealing with the Anabaptiſts, to plead for the reſtoring of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, Publick Confirmation of all that have bin Baptized in Infancy, as their ſolemn entrance into the ſtate of Adult Members; and I preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make an humble motion to the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry to take it into conſideration, and (pag. 120, 121, 122.) gave in ſome proofs of the neceſſity of a perſonal Covenanting of the Adult, beſides the Infant-Covenant by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>What others thought of this Motion, I know not, but my Reverend Brethren of this County, who after Aſſociated for the better managing of their Miniſterial work, did ſo far approve the matter, that they readily concurred to make it one Article of their agreement at our Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in theſe words, [R. 7. <hi>We ſhall diſtinguiſh between Infant-Members and Adult: and for the former we ſhall take their Parents profeſſion; and for the latter we ſhall expect their own. And though it cannot be determined juſt to a day or year when any is paſt his Infant Church-eſtate, yet none muſt be Enrolled and accounted among Adult and Perfect Members, till they perſonally and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſhall make their Profeſſion; whether it be only of their Faith and Obedience to Chriſt, that they may be eſteemed Adult Members of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church; or alſo their conſent to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular Church.</hi>] We thought not meet to make Impoſition of hands then an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Agreement, becauſe its poſſible ſome good men might differ in it. But the neceſſity of publick perſonal profeſſion we agreed of. But
<pb facs="tcp:58862:19"/>ſtill the moſt are too ſlack in the execution. Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday in the concluſion of a Diſcourſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, I thought it my duty to motion ſuch a thing to my Auditory, as the publick owning of Converſion, and lamenting the ſins of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, and profeſſion of Reſolutions for a Holy life: And preſently the ſame day this Treatiſe came to be offered to my peruſal, though my judgment be not of that weight as to add much to the reputation of it, yet the Treatiſe hath that Evidence which I hope hath added ſomewhat to my judgment.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Author I am utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: but in this Learned, Judicious, Pious Exercitation, I ſee much more of him than the face. The ſubject I take to be of very great uſefulneſſe; and the manner of handling it needs not my commendations. I hope the Lord hath in compaſſion to this diſtempred Church, ſent them this Reforming, Healing Truth, by the hand of this our Reverend Brother. It is a point that ſhould be entertained with univerſal alacrity, upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſo commonly received by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and therefore among us the leſſe lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oppoſition; though unhapily the practice of too many hath overlooked it, yet by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, cheaper way of writing and ſpeaking for it, the moſt have given it a fair complemental en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is ſo excellently ſuited to the joint promoteing of Holineſſe and Unity, that it ſeems a ſalve juſt fitted to our ſore; where one part runs away from Purity, for fear of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
<pb facs="tcp:58862:20"/>and the other runs away from Unity, for fear of Impurity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And withall, our great ſin againſt God and his Church, by ſo long and common a neglect of this Duty, ſhould awake tender conſciences to penitency, and the readier obedience for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Though the Papiſts themſelves do agree with us for Confirmation, yet their Confirmation and ours is not indeed the ſame thing. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> were ſo much offended at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants difference from them about Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they thundred againſt them divers <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's [Si quis dixerit Confirmationem Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatorum otiaſam Ceremoniam eſſe, &amp; non poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us verum &amp; proprium ſacramentum, aut o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim nihil aliud fuiſſe quam Catecheſin quandam qua adoleſcentiae proximi fidei ſuae rationem coram Eccleſia exponebant, Anathema, ſit. 3. ſiquis dixerit ſanctae Confirmationis ordinarium Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum non eſſe ſolum Epiſcopum ſed quemvis ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem Sacerdotem, Anathema ſit.</hi>—But theſe Fathers might have leſt out the <hi>nihil ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud,</hi> when they read our Divines maintaining the uſe of Exploration, Prayer, Approbation with Impoſition of hands alſo, in this duty. But I hope no Proteſtants now will diſown or caſt by that ſort of Confirmation, which the Papal Council curſed our Anceſtors for maintaining, I confeſſe this duty was ſo timely corrupted, that hath given the Papiſts the greater pretence to Antiquity for their way! They did betimes make ſuch haſte to it, as that they annexed it cloſe to Baptiſm; and they quickly introduced
<pb facs="tcp:58862:20"/>the Croſſing and Chriſm. But from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo.</p>

               <item>1. That Infant covenanting by Parents will ſerve only for an Infant Church-ſtate and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, is paſt all queſtion. Otherwiſe an Atheiſt might be ſaved, or at leaſt have communion with the Church upon his Infant-title. But its paſt doubt that an infant-title is upon the parents faith (for nothing is required beforehand, but if he be the ſeed of a believer) and this ceaſeth when he comes to age, if he add not the title of the adult, which is perſonal faith (or profeſſion, <hi>coram Eccleſiâ.</hi>)</item>
               <item>2. And if the Adult muſt have a new title, the Church muſt have notice of it, before ſhe can admit them to the Communion of the Adult: for we judg not of things that have no manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>

               <item> 3. And the ſolemn perſonal covenanting with God, (or owning the Baptiſmal Covenant) which is this very title, I have in the place forecited proved from Scripture, and it hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the Church.</item>

            <p>I anſwer, 1. As to the latter, it is true: But it is a profeſſion connexed with ſuch high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that a precedent Profeſſion is neceſſary to prove mens title to them As to the former, If the profeſſion he not ſolemn, ſerious, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, explicite, it will be next to none, and unfit to attain its ends.

               </gap>ting perverſneſſe they would reaſon us down to the very loweſt degree, as the profane would do about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of godlineſs: and becauſe an implicite and hardly-diſcernable Covenant or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſent, may prove the truth of our
<pb facs="tcp:58862:21"/>Churches, therefore in dayes of Liberty we muſt go no higher; though experience tells us, that many conſent, not as not underſtanding the thing they ſhould have conſented to! God in Nature hath made the tongue to expreſs the mind, and yet ſome quarrel with us for calling them to this natural expreſſion; and if we aske them an account of their Faith and holineſs, or whether they are Chriſtians or Church-members, we are ſuppoſed to do them wrong, becauſe we take it not for granted, or diſcern not their mind by their coming to Church, or ſome more dumb and uncertain ſignes, even when we ſee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignorance, ungodlineſs and looſneſs of the world, and multitudes maliciouſly oppoſing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Sure I am, that the adult in the Apoſtles daies were called to publick profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance, even at the time of their baptizing, (if baptized at age): and I doubt not but that will prove the continued neceſſity of ſuch profeſſion of the Adult, though they were baptized in infancy upon another account. The benefits that this Ordinance of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon ſolemn perſonal profeſſion is like to bring to the Church, are very many and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is like to be a great means to deſtroy the groundleſſe ſecurity and falſe hopes of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the ungodly: Now they truſt to this, that they are Chriſtians and regenerate, becauſe they are baptized and come to Church, with ſuch like grounds; but then they would be brought to ſee that more is neceſſary: when their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal converſion, faith, repentance, hope, love are
<pb facs="tcp:58862:22"/>inquired after, and they underſtand that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be ſolemnly given of them, or els they ſhall remain viſibly in the rank of the impenitent and unbelievers, or of meer ſeekers after a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, and when they ſee a Viſible difference made by a publick Ordinance between Believing Penitent perſons and other men, this is like to do much to awaken them to look after a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate that they may be Confirmed: And though ſome will but ſpeak to avoid the ſhame that follows their abode in an unconfirmed ſtate, that ſo they may be taken to be Chriſtians, yet I ſhould rejoice that Chriſtianity may have ſuch an advantage, as may entice men generally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſeem converted men; for while they are learning how to <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo, they may meet with that which may teach them to <hi>be</hi> ſo; in the mean time diſcouragements are removed and godlineſs it ſelf by their profeſſion honoured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will do very much to ſatisfie the common ſcruples of Miniſters and Churches about the qualifications of Communicants, and end the differences about it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may much tend to the agreement of the Presbyterians, Congregationals, Eraſtians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the quality of Church-members, and general admiſſion to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it calm not the Anabaptiſts, yet it will anſwer their greateſt objection; which is, That Adult Baptiſm layeth a moſt ſolemn obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on men, and without it moſt are brought to delude themſelves by a confidence in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm: Whereas we ſhall ſhew them that we take a meer Infant-title to be inſufficient for
<pb facs="tcp:58862:22"/>the Adult as well as they, and that it ceaſeth if perſonal faith be not added: and that we are deſirous as well as they that the fulleſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be laid on the adult; and that ſo great a work ſhould be publickly and ſolemnly done, that the obligation may be the greater, and the <hi>tarnſitus</hi> into ſo deſirable a condition, may by the ſolemnity be made the more obſervable to all, eſpecially to the careleſs that are apt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch ſolemn diſcrimination to overlook it: And ſo Confirmation will attain thoſe ends, which they miſtakingly think rebaptizing muſt obtain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But who be they that you would have Confirmed? the truly converted only, or thoſe that profeſs ſo much, or thoſe that profeſs a common ſort of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſpoken to this in my Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Right to Sacraments, at large. The caſe is eaſie: Sincerity we know not certainly in others: Profeſſion with ſeeming ſeriouſnes and underſtanding, is undoubtedly the ſign by which we muſt judge of it.</p>
            <p>He that Profeſſeth true Faith, Repentance, Love and Reſolution for a Holy life, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Regeneration: and no lower profeſſion muſt ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But this will bring up an affected for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſhew of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> when men are thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to make a profeſſion of it, before the experience of it on their ſouls do conſtrain them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some accidental evils will follow the nobleſt and moſt neceſſary duty: but the
<pb facs="tcp:58862:23"/>good that follows wil incomparably weigh down that evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And do you think that this formal ſhew of Holineſs is not a better condition, at leaſt, as to others, and the proſperity of the Goſpel, then to have men deſpiſers and perſecuters of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? When Holineſſe is under a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and owned by all, O what an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive it is to the minds of the ignorant, and how faire are they for a true converſion! But when it is the common ſcorn, what danger are they in by examples and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>The Church is at the beſt when there are moſt Hypocrites: for when there are moſt Hypocrites, there are alſo moſt true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Hypocrites may be miſerable themſelves, but they may much help the Church when Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, prophane men, and perſecuters much hinder it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But this Confirmation will grow in time but to a Ceremony: Careleſſe Miniſters will Confirm any body, and huddle it up as the Biſhops did with the Boyes, Confirming an hundred in half an hour whom they never ſpake a word to, nor ſaw before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All Ordinances will be uſed as the perſons be that uſe them. Bad men will abuſe them; godly ſerious Miniſters will do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And if this ſhould move us to lay them quite by, it may move us alſo to do ſo by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other Ordinances, which the careleſs will uſe careleſſely.</p>

            <p> Two paſſages in this Book I ſuſpect ſome will ſtumble at;</p>
            <p>One is making the Catechumens to be a ſort of Church-Members. But this is eaſily decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Catechumeni ſtrictly ſo called that are unbaptized:
<list>
                  <item>Are 1. Some of them true believers, and theſe are therefore Members of the Church as invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</item>
                  <item>2. Some of them do Profeſſe true Faith and Repentance openly, though the Paſtors have yet delayed their Baptiſm: Theſe are Members of the Viſible Church, as a King not yet Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a Souldier not yet Liſted, though Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally Contracted; as married perſons contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but not ſolemnly married, have their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: They are incompletely Viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</item>
                  <item>3. The ſame perſons when Baptized are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely Viſible Members.</item>
                  <item>4. But ſome of the Catechumeni are only yet learning what Chriſtianity is, and do not yet know it, or at leaſt conſent to it, or diſcover this conſent, though they are willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; And theſe are not Members of the Church, but in the way to it; being under that firſt teaching that makes Diſciples, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſecond (to obſerve all things command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) proper to Diſciples.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And as for the Catechumens, more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, that is, ſuch children as were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, they are Infant-Church-Members (till they are Adult, and then their Memberſhip ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb facs="tcp:58862:24"/>if they add not the Profeſſion of perſonal Faith.</p>
            <p>The other paſſage is, That (pag. 60.) the Confirmed only are made the Object of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. But undoubtedly the Reverend Author there means not thoſe only that are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly confirmed by Impoſition of hands; but any that have openly owned their Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and have been thereupon admitted into the Communion of the Adult.</p>
            <p>I conclude with this earneſt requeſt to all the godly Miniſters of theſe Nations, that they would take this matter into their ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether God do not offer you by the hand of this Reverend Brother the very Key that muſt let us into Unity and Reformation? and whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be not for want of the right Key, that we have ſtood wrangling and groping ſo long at the door. Paſs not this over with a bare reading, but Aſſemble together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult whether this be the way of God or not: If you are unſatisfied, deſire the Author to confirm his Doctrine of Confirmation, and anſwer your Objections. If you ſee it to be the way, in the Name of God let us be true to God, the Church, the Truth and our ſelves, and preſently all agree upon the practice. If we will not, it will be ſaid by this age and poſterity, That it was the idleneſſe, or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or contentiouſneſſe of Miniſters, that undid <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we will be unanimouſly up and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God will be with us, and we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:58862:24"/>to expect moſt bleſſed effects; and I doubt not but <hi>England</hi> will find cauſe in the fruits of our labours, to praiſe God for the endeavours of this Reverend Author. Theſe are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of <hi>Your unworthy fellow-ſervant,</hi> RICH. BAXTER.</p>

            <p>TRuth is ſo pretious a thing, <hi>eſpecially</hi> that which refers to our information, for the better regulating of our affairs to the glory of God, that both it, and the feet of them that bring it ſhould be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our eys, and welcome to us. Many truths of this concernment, if not of their own nature, <hi>for that of godlineſſe,</hi> as appears by the many controverſies about it, <hi>is without controverſie a great Myſtery:</hi> Yet either by reaſon of our dim-ſightedneſs, being not able to ſee afar off, nor to penetrate into the depth and bottome of them, or by reaſon of the abuſive traditions, and corrupt gloſſes with which for many ages they have been clouded and overcaſt, <hi>both which do exceedingly hinder our underſtanding of them.</hi> I ſay upon theſe and ſuch like accounts, many truths ſeem not to be ſo clear, but that they ſtill need a further clearing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58862:26"/>
            <p> Among others, ſuch as relate to Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and order, have for a long time been under debate, <hi>and not without ſome conſiderable advantage,</hi> though I humbly conceive we have not attained ſo far as to be already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>It remains therefore that we would preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not be ſo paſſionately fond of our own prepoſſeſt conceptions, as not to have the patience to conſider what may be offered to us, <hi>eſpecially,</hi> by ſuch as are well-wiſhers to <hi>Sion,</hi> and deſirous to ſee the Goſpel-Temple in its beauty.</p>
            <p>If any perſons are ſpirited to ſearch after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knowledg in theſe affairs, to dig for it as for hid treaſure, and when they have found a vein of golden Ore, to refine and ſtamp it for us, we ſhould be in readineſs to receive the truth in the Love of it, and to pay it the tribute and homage of obedience, for the ſake of the God of truth, whoſe image and ſuperſcription it bears.</p>
            <p>What great and profitable pains <hi>my much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friend</hi> the Reverend Author of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exercitation, hath taken in this one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular preſented to conſideration, and with what Curiouſneſſe, without curioſity? with what <hi>(as the Apoſtle)</hi> Craft, without fraud? with what Pompe, without pride? with what Learning, without oſtentation? with what Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, without obſcurity? <hi>In a word,</hi> with how ſweet a Religious ingenuity, and to what noble ends, he hath laid, managed and finiſht this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable plot, you will beſt perceive by the view
<pb facs="tcp:58862:26"/>and peruſal of it? and though my opinion be of very little ſignification yet I cannot forbear to ſay, That as to the ſubſtance and main of the deſign, I judge it to be of ſo conſiderable an importance, that I do not ſee how it can be neglected without a very great prejudice to Church-Communion; <hi>to ſay no more.</hi> Haply ſome may be ſo nice as to be offended with the name, and diſlike <hi>Confirmation</hi> for fear of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoping,</hi> as if that old faſhiond-garment had but a peece of new-nam'd cloth put to it, and dreſt up in another mode; if it were ſo, can no good come out of Nazareth? <hi>Bonus odor verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ex re qualibet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any are under ſuch a fear, I think I may aſſure them that they are more afraid than hurt, <hi>yea, afraid where no fear is,</hi> as they will quickly find, if they but pleaſe to come and ſee.</p>
            <p>As for you <hi>Noble Bereans,</hi> I ſhall detain you no longer, but to pray you that <hi>according to your wonted gentleneſſe and Ingenuity,</hi> you would conſider of what is ſaid, and to ſearch the Scriptures to ſee whether theſe things are ſo.</p>
            <p>Now the God of truth give us a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all truth, that we may Know and believe, love and live the truth as it is in and from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is <hi>the</hi> way, <hi>the</hi> truth, and <hi>the</hi> life. <hi>Vincat veritas,</hi> let truth go on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer; which is the hearty praier of the Authors much obliged, and ambitious to be his and every mans humble Servant in the

            <p>Of this Impoſition of hands, Confirmation or Unction (for all three names are given to the ſame thing) that I may ſpeak the more clearly and diſtinctly, we are to know, That in the Primitive times among thoſe that were of and belonging to the Church, were ſuch as were cald and commonly known by the name of Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58862:35"/>being the loweſt rank or claſſis, and as it were the ſeed-plot and nurſery of the Church. And of theſe there were two ſorts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as being heathens and infidels by birth, yet by ſome means or other began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and imbrace the Chriſtian Religion. And let it not ſeem ſtrange, that I inſert theſe into the number of ſuch as are within the Church, ſeeing they are in ſome ſort truly ſo, and were ſo accounted of; the Church taking cognizance and care of them, yea and making ſome ſuitable proviſion for them as ſuch. Thus that inquiſitive Antiquary <hi>Albaſpinaeus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſervat. lib. 2. cap. 3.</note>

            <p>And as this is a Laudable and neceſſary courſe to be taken for the right admiſſion of perſons unto full memberſhip; ſo doth it appear to have been the practice of the Church of Chriſt in all ages (though corruptions have invaded this as well as other uſages, yea ſo overgrown it, as to the true Primitive Notion, Nature and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58862:44"/>End, or Uſe of it, it hath lain hid, and been unknown for many Centuries of years together) and to have ſome probable ground in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both which I ſhall endeavour in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A probable ground hereof in the Scripture we have, in Heb. 6.2. <hi>of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and laying on of hands:</hi> Where this is made one of the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt; <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of laying on of hands.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58862:46"/>ſuch as had been baptized, is of no leſſe then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Inſtitution, and of no later date, which ought ſtill to be practiſed in the Churches of Chriſt. To which add <hi>Hyperius, qui intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit,</hi> Heb. 6.2. <hi>de impoſitione manuum, quae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebat &amp; in Confirmatione eorum qui jam erant Baptizati, &amp; rectè inſtituti, ut acciperent Spiritum ſanctum, &amp; de Ordinatione.</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. of Impoſition of hands, which was made uſe of, both in the Corfirmation of thoſe that had been baptized and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt.

I ſhall cloſe the poſitions of this Text, with that of the learned and godly Mr. <hi>Deering,</hi> in his Lectures upon part of this Epiſtle: which is full to our purpoſe. Impoſition of hands, ſaith he, was a ſolemn Ceremony uſed with Prayer, in which it was declared, that the parties were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God into his Church, according to the faith of Chriſt, which they then profeſſed —. This which this day ought to be practiſed as a thing very profitable in the Church of God, is miſerably defaced by the Papiſts; for where it was in the Church of God an uſe, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58862:46"/>children ſhould be taught the Principles of Faith, which when they had well learned then in the open Congregation, with prayer and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands on their heads, they were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be received as partakers of the graces and Sacraments of the Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By theſe, and other Expoſitors that might be added, is this place of Scripture underſtood in part at leaſt of Impoſition of hands in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; which therefore, in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is warranted by it, as a Doctrine funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental that ought to be known by all (unleſſe it be underſtood of the time when the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals there mentioned, were to be profeſſed) and a thing practiſed by, and taking its riſe from the very Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was accordingly received by the Church and continued in the following ages, though by degrees it came to be corrupted, and much changed from its Primitive uſe and end. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> a moſt learned man,<note place="margin">In Praefar. ad apparat.

            <p>Lo here repreſented unto us a lively Scheme of Primitive Confirmation, recovered from the dark and duſt, by thoſe firſt reformers! wherein it evidently appears what thoughts they had of it, and how uſeful and neceſſary they judged it to be, as the only way whereby ſuch as were adult, ought to be admitted to full-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, and the actual enjoyment of all Church priviledges.</p>

            <p>Now from all that hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe, theſe inſuing Corollaries or inferences may be fairly deduced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the children of believers, who have been baptized, do ſtand, while they remain ſuch incompleatly in Church ſtate, not upon their own, but upon the account of their parents. For they are coaſidered as comprehended in them, or parts of them, and for their parents ſake were ſo far owned as to be admitted unto Baptiſm; and this by virtue of the covenant, which is made to, and comprehends the parents in the firſt place: And the children ſecondarily, as deſcending from ſuch parents; for thus it runs:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> 
               <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant (ſaith the Lord)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58862:61"/>between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, to be a God unto thee and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cobbet. vindic.</note> The Jews and Proſelytes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are externally in Covenant in their parents right; God accepting the actual owning of the Covenant by the parents in ſtead of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> The ſame Author opening the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. thus ſaith, The Covenant, and Church-eſtate of Covenant, and inchu ched parents, is firſtly the parents Friviledge, and ſo to be conſidered. From hence ariſeth the Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral or Eccleſiaſtical holineſſe of ſuch children, by virtue whereof they are intituled to Baptiſm, and differenced from other children; who, if conſidered in themſelves, would be in the ſame condition with others; <hi>viz. Extranei</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean as well as they; tis the parents Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from whence they have this priviledge, as appears from thoſe paſſages of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe, Rom. 11.16. <hi>If the root be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo are the branches:</hi> And 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>The unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the believing wiſe, and the unbelieving wiſe is ſanctified by the believing husband, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy:</hi> viz. Foederally or Eccleſiaſtically ſo. Thus are they after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in Church-ſtate, but yet incompletely ſo, becauſe not <hi>perfectè Chriſtiani nec conſummati quoad Eccleſiaſticam perfectionem,</hi> as hath been before declared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Baptiſm only, doth neither intitle a perſon unto, nor make him Proximately capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any further Church priviledge: They were, in this regard ranked among the Ca techu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58862:62"/>who, we know, were not admmitted ſo much as to be preſent at, nor to behold the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Lords Supper; nor were the myſteries of the Sacraments opened and made-known to them, as hath been ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Ordinance of the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred unto the baptized in infancy, when they are grown up to years of diſcretion, meerly upon the account of their baptiſm; which as it gave them a being in the Church, after a ſort, and incompleat only; ſo do they by it acquire only a Fundamental and Remote, but not a Formal and Proximate right unto all other ordinances. Tis indeed <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> but not <hi>ſolitaria per ſe ſufficiens,</hi> for the inveſting of them with all Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: for, though not ſuch, as ſuch, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch only; yet none but ſuch are to be admitted unto full communion; there being two doors to be paſſed through before we can come <hi>ad adyta &amp; intima Eccleſiae penetralia;</hi> viz. Baptiſm and Confirmation: whereof the latter properly and immediately gives admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but withal our arrival ſo far, preſuppoſeth our entrance in by the former.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That a diſtinction is, and ought to be made between <hi>Eccleſiam infantum Baptizato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,<note place="margin">in Heb. 6.2.</note> &amp; adultorum Confirmatorum:</hi> thus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus. <hi>Infantes Chriſtianorum jure promiſſionis Baptizabaxtur in infantiá, pueritiam egreſſi impoſitione manuum in Eccleſiam adultorum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiebantur.</hi> The infants of Chriſtians are by virtue of the promiſe baptized in infancy, and,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58862:62"/>having paſt their child-hood, are by impoſition of hands received into the Church of the adult. Not that theſe were two diſtinct Churches, (for they did both concur according to their ſeveral capacities to the making up of one) but rather two diſtinct forms or Claſſes of perſons, of and in one and the ſame Church: Which two ſorts, as they enjoy their ſtanding upon different grounds, ſo are they by the Church dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and entertained in a different manner: The one ſhe ſuckles as in infancy, with the milke of principles; but ſpreads a table for, and ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore the other ſtrong meat, and variety of diſhes, as it were; as a wiſe <hi>mater-familias</hi> ſuiting their food and fare unto the condition and quality of the perſons in her family, giving unto each their proper portion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Baptized in infancy, when grown up to years of diſcretion, are to ſtand upon ther own bottom, and to be conſidered by the Church as in themſelves, and no longer in their parents, as formerly. For now the Church is to take cognizance of ſuch, as obliged to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of perſonal ſervice to the Lord (being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ability ſo to do) which, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents cannot perform for them, ſo neither can they exempt them from it. They have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, and continued in the family hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, becauſe they were born of ſuch parents as belonged to, and were full members of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But now muſt they make good their ſtanding for themſelves, if they will injoy further priviledges.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:58862:63"/> 6. That in thoſe who have been baptized in infancy, and are now adult, ſomewhat more is requiſite in themſelves, and to be by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and manifeſted, before the Church can warrantably proceed to the admiſſion of them to full Memberſhip, and the actual injoyment of all Church-priviledges; becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being of ability, in point of age, and uſe of reaſon, to act as Church-members, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo to do: Nor will the ſtate and action of their parents ſtand them in any ſtead, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice any longer in their behalf. The conſent of the parents was indeed at firſt ſufficient for the intituling of them both to the covenant, and alſo the initiatory Seal thereof, they not being able to perform it themſelves: But now being adult, and ſo conſequently of ability, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal actual conſent is requiſite to their injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any further benefit or bleſſing of the Covenant; for the Lord intruſts a perſon with no talent, but he expects the improvement of it, that being his end in beſtowing it. And as in <hi>ſubjecto capaci</hi> perſonal faith in the heart, and confeſſion with the mouth is required unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.10.</note> ſo likewiſe is it here, in ſuch a ſubject the actual owning of the terms of the Covenant, and voluntary ingaging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; as alſo profeſſion of the faith, and viſible holineſſe; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as upon probable ground may rationally by the rules of the Word be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the converſation of the perſon, are requiſite for the warranting of the Church in her proceeding to the admiſſion of ſuch a one as was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. That the baptized in infancy, when grown up to years of diſcretion, if they either offer not themſelves willingly, or offering themſelves, cannot give a ſatisfactory account of their Faith and manner of life unto the Church for their admiſſion, are to continue and to be left in that condition, without enjoying any further pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. For their actuall and full joyning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, muſt be an act of their own; to which, that it may be duly performed, tisre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that they therein be free and voluntary, as alſo fitly qualified. Without the latter, the Churches act in admitting of them would be unwarrantable, they not proceeding herein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Word: And without the former, the act of the perſons ſo offering themſelves would be invalid and of no force, as to the thing intended; <hi>viz.</hi> Communion, and the benefit accruing thereby, whereunto the conſent of the perſons is chiefly requiſite, which is not truly ſuch, unleſſe it be free, and neither feigned nor forced.

            <p n="8">8. That the Cenſure of Excommunication cannot regularly be made uſe of, nor exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed toward ſuch as having been Baptized, are adult, but not Confirmed. For they never were full members, nor had actual or a Prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate right unto the Lords Supper, or other the priviledges of ſuch as are compleat Members: and therefore neither are they the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Excommunication, nor can they be deprived by it, or cut off from the injoyment of that, which Eccleſiaſtically they never had a right unto, nor were actually poſſeſſed of. For which cauſe it might be, that the penitents in the Primitive times, who had been under that cenſure, and by it cut off from their ſtate of fellowſhip with the Church, upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn were received into the communion of the Church again, not by iteration of Baptiſm, but by Impoſition of hands only; intimating hereby thus much to us, That by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they were deprived not of their Baptiſm, but only of thoſe priviledges which by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands in their Confirmation they had been entituled and admitted to the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and therefore upon their repentance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58862:65"/>were they by the ſame way reſtored unto them again.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the denyal of any further Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge unto ſuch as were Baptized in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and are adult, but not Confirmed, can be no injury unto them at all; for injury in the denyal of a thing to any perſon, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth his lawful title and right thereunto; which not being the caſe of ſuch adult as have nothing to plead for their right unto ſuch priviledges, but their Infant-Baptiſm on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the denyal of them gives them no juſt cauſe at all to complain of any wrong herein done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That all perſons baptized and not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, are not, nor ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Chruch-Members, as to the actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of further Church-Priviledges. For, as more then meer Baptiſm is requiſite to the intituling of perſons unto ſuch priviledges; <hi>viz.</hi> Confirmation, that properly admits them to full Communion, and gives them their Proximate right, as to the actual injoyment of them: So, meer Baptiſm makes not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a meet object of Excommunication, and ſuch a one as may be regularly proceeded againſt by that cenſure, as the contrary Tenet plainly ſuppoſeth.</p>
            <p>Which being the Condition of moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt us at this day, I conceive, that the leaving of them unto inſtitution by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing and the Miniſtry of the Word, that ſo they may come to the knowledge of, and be acquainted, as they ought, with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
